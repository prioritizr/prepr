### Overview

The _prepr R_ R package is used to repair broken spatial polygons. To achieve this, the package uses the constrained triangulation approach implemented in the [`prepair`](https://github.com/tudelft3d/prepair) C++ library ([Ledoux et al. 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2014.01.009)). Specifically, the `st_prepair()` function is used to repair polygons. For more information, please see the package vignette.

### Installation

The latest version can be installed from the [online source code repository](https://github.com/prioritizr/prepr) using the following _R_ code.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("prioritizr/prepr")
```

#### Windows

The [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) software needs to be installed to install the _prepr R_ package from source. This software provides system requirements from [rwinlib](https://github.com/rwinlib/).

#### Ubuntu

The `gmp`, `mpfr`, and `gdal` libraries need to be installed to install the _prepr R_ package. For recent versions of Ubuntu (18.04 and later), these libraries are available through official repositories. They can be installed using the following system commands:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get install \
  libudunits2-dev libgdal-dev libgeos-dev libproj-dev \
  libsqlite0-dev libgmp3-dev libmpfr-dev
```

#### Linux

For Unix-alikes, `gmp` (>= 4.2.3), `mpfr` (>= 3.0.0), and `gdal` (>= 2.0.1) are required.

#### macOS

The `pkg-config`, `gmp`, `mpfr`, and `gdal` libraries are required. The easiest way to install these libraries is using [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/). After installing HomeBrew, these libraries can be installed using the following commands in the system terminal:

```
brew install pkg-config
brew install gmp
brew install mpfr
brew install gdal
```

### Usage

Here we provide a short example showing how the _prepr_ package can be used to repair broken polygon geometries. To start with, we will load the package. We will also load the _sf_ package for working with spatial data.

```{r, message = FALSE}
# load packages
library(sf)    # package for working with spatial data
library(prepr) # package for repairing spatial geometries
```

Next, we will create a broken spatial polygon.

```{r}
# create broken polygon
x <- st_as_sfc("POLYGON((0 0, 0 10, 10 0, 10 10, 0 0))")

# verify that polygon is broken, and display reason why it's broken
st_is_valid(x, reason = TRUE)
```

Now we will use the `st_prepair()` function to repair the broken polygon.

```{r}
# repair the polygon
y <- st_prepair(x)

# verify that repaired polygon is NOT broken
st_is_valid(y)
```

Finally, we can compare the two polygons. To achieve this, let's plot both the two polygons (shown in gray) and also plot the vertices for the two polygons (shown in red).

```{r figure, fig.height = 4.0, fig.width = 7.0}
# visualize the polygons
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(0, 0, 2.5, 0))
plot(x, main = "original", col = "#999999")
points(st_coordinates(st_cast(x, "POINT")), col = "#e41a1c", pch = 16, cex = 2)
plot(y, main = "repaired", col = "#999999")
points(st_coordinates(st_cast(y, "POINT")), col = "#e41a1c", pch = 16, cex = 2)
```

Although we can see that both of the polygons (shown in gray) appear visually identical, the repaired polygon (`y`) has an additional vertex (red point) in the center of the 'bowtie'. This extra vertex is important to maintain the validity fo the spatial polygon. For more information and additional examples, see the [package vignette](https://prioritizr.github.io/prepr/articles/prepr.html).
